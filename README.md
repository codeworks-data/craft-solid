Learn the SOLID principle by practice !


---

## S: single-responsibility principle

A class or function should have only one job. One reason to change.


Refactor the functions in S.py to respect this principle.


## O: Open/closed principle

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extensions, but closed for modification.

This means that if we want to add specific behaviour to a preexisting code, we should be able to add it without 
changing what is already there.

Polymorphism is often used for this one.

Refactor the function in O.py to respect this principle and keep in mind that we may want to add more specific behaviour
in the near future.
